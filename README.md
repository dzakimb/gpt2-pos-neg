# Text Generation for Positive Sentences using GPT-2

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Text Generation for Positive Sentences using GPT-2 project! This project focuses on leveraging the power of GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, to generate positive and uplifting sentences.

## Project Description

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a text generation system that produces positive and optimistic sentences. GPT-2, being a powerful language model, is trained on diverse datasets, and with fine-tuning, it can be geared towards generating content with a positive sentiment.

### Key Features

- **GPT-2 Text Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-2 for natural language generation.
- **Positive Sentiment Focus:** The model is fine-tuned to generate text with a positive and uplifting sentiment.
- **Customization:** Easily adaptable for different positive text generation tasks.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/positive-text-generation.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Fine-tune the Model:**
    - Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your positive sentiment dataset. Refer to the fine-tuning documentation for details.

4. **Generate Positive Sentences:**
    - Use the trained model to generate positive sentences. Check the provided notebooks or scripts for examples.
